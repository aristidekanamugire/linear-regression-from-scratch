# linear-regression-from-scratch
Univariate linear regression implemented from scratch in Python (NumPy only). Includes cost function, gradient descent, visualizations, and predictions — perfect for learning the fundamentals of machine learning.

### What’s Inside
- `C1_W2_Linear_Regression.ipynb` – Complete Jupyter notebook
- Implements:
  - Cost function J(w,b)
  - Gradient computation (∂J/∂w and ∂J/∂b)
  - Batch gradient descent from scratch
  - Training loop with cost history
  - Final model visualization and predictions
- Dataset: `ex1data1.txt` → restaurant profit vs city population

### Key Results
- Final parameters: `w ≈ 1.166`, `b ≈ -3.63`
- Converged cost: `~4.48` (after 1500 iterations, α = 0.01)
- Prediction examples:
  - 35,000 people → **$45,197** profit
  - 70,000 people → **$453,425** profit
